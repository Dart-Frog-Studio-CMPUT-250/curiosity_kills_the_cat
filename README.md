## Gameplay

In Curiosity Killed the Cat, you take on the role of Felix Catis, a son on a journey to discover what happened to his missing father.

Armed with only his father’s hiking journal and his wits, Felix must make his way through a time-warped cabin, solve challenging puzzles and solve the mystery of what happened with his father’s disappearance.

Felix discovers a medallion amongst other objects that once belonged to his father, with the ability to manipulate the environment around him, allowing Felix to traverse and solve the puzzles that stand between him and the truth.

Curiosity Killed the Cat was created during the Winter 2022 semester for CMPT 250 at the University of Alberta
